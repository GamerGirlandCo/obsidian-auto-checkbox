# As-Of-Yet Untitled Recursive To-Do checker for obsidian

idk what to call this i'm sorry :(

anyways, you don't need to configure anything. just enable the plugin, reload obsidian, and click on a task with subtasks and everything underneath it will magically be ticked off as done!

this plugin requires `obsidian-dataview`.

# todo
- [ ] refactor live preview completion to trigger clicks on the checkboxes as opposed to editing the lines manually...
