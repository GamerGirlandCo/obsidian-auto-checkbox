# Obsidian Automatic Recursive Task Completer

anyways, you don't need to configure anything. just enable the plugin, reload obsidian, and click on a task with subtasks and everything underneath it will magically be ticked off as done!

this plugin requires `obsidian-dataview`.

# todo
- [x] ~~refactor live preview completion to trigger clicks on the checkboxes as opposed to editing the lines manually...~~
